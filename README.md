# Hi, I'm William Alexander :sunglasses:

I'm a student of computer engineering :school: who is passionate about open 
source software, Linux and cryptography.

The first programming language that I learned was C, and since then I try to 
code everything on it, but sadly :sweat_smile: not everything can be coded in C.
That's why I try to learn other languages like Python and Assembly. I like how 
slick and powerful Linux is and how you can make everything work on it; that's 
why my projects will be focused on this awesome operating system.

I think that you never stop learning, that's why I accept your feedback about
improvements of my code.
